# Get details from website
This script is written to extract some parts of the source code of the target website. In the near future I will work on updates to identify some information from headers and responses. Any suggestions and cowork are appreciated.

- HTTP response headers
- Metadata of the website
- Hyperlinks
- Comments

Run: pip3 install - r requirements.txt
